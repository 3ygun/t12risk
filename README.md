<h2>Presents: TwitchPlaysRisk (Kinda)</h2>
<p>Our goal for the 2014 Ohi/o Hack-a-thon was to create a version of Risk which can be played via communal text input on the game streaming site Twitch.tv!  The idea was originally prompted by the popularity of TwitchPlaysPokemon which has a similar game play style but for the various Pokemon games.</p>
<p>In order to create this project we decided to use JavaScript.  Specifically, Microsoft's JavaScript superset TypeScript which provided us with a more familiar syntax than standard JavaScript.  It was everyone's <b>first</b> time writing JavaScript/TypeScript.</p>
