<h2>Presents: TwitchPlaysRisk (Kinda)</h2>
<p>Our goal for the 2014 Ohi/o Hack-a-thon was to create a version of Risk which can be played via communial text input on the game streaming site Twitch.tv!  The idea was originally prompted by to popularity of TwitchPlaysPokemon which is similar game play style but for the various Pokemon games.</p>
<p>In order to construct this project we decided to use JavaScript.  Specifically Microsoft's JavaScript subset TypeScript which provided us with a more formular syntax then standard JavaScript.  <b>It was everyone's first time writing JavaScript/TypeScript.</b></p>
