//Good evening,
//	We are pleased to have you with us today! The main intent for this project
//is to create a closely based replica of the "old classic" board game Risk, called 
//Riske! Though this might seem an easy task at the beginning but take the small
//scale board game and make it global. By use of the popular game streaming site 
//Twitch we wil be broadcasting a live game of web-based Riske with live inputs from 
//participation over the twitch comment stream.
